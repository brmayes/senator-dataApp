# senator-dataApp

NEEDED REQUIREMENTS:
Project should start by displaying the Senate seating chart. It should show all seats, available and
unavailable. This could be in list format or graphically represented.
- Seats, represented by rows or graphics, should be colored for the party that holds them. Open seats should be highlighted and clickable.
- Your seats (or states) should be sortable in some fashion. The user should be able to click and change the way that the seats or states are displayed. This should help the user to digest and access the information.
- Project must include a credits link with your credit and source attribution.
- Remember: you only have to use one photo per open seat. Your application design should handle displaying multiple photos or a single photo.
- Project should be professionally designed and responsive.
